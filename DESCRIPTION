Description: Enables the computation of the 'two cut-points with maximum odds ratio (OR)
    value method' for data analysis, particularly suited for binary classification
    tasks. Users can identify optimal cut-points in a continuous variable by
    maximizing the odds ratio while maintaining an equal risk level, useful for
    tasks such as medical diagnostics, risk assessment, or predictive modeling.
